== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will this Starter Site plugin work with my theme? =

The starter sites are built using Sydney, Botiga and Airi. We suggest picking your favourite and using that. 

= Are there any FREE starter sites? =

You will get several FREE pre-made websites. There are many more premium starters that can be accessed when you purchase our PRO version.

= Can I import a starter site on an existing website? =

It is recommended to install and import a website demo on a fresh WordPress installation or a blank website to avoid overriding settings and page design. However, a page template can be imported on an existing website as well.

= Do I need to install any other plugin before importing a starter site? =

All you need to do is install the Starter Sites plugin and select the website demo you wish to import. This step will install and activate the necessary plugins.

= Will you add more starter sites? =

Yes, of course! We are working on many more free and pro starter demos.
